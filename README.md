This program is a R Shiny visualisation that I made for a course in GIS at UCL and is my first interactive visualisation. 

In order to run this file, load the R.data, server.R and user.R files in R studio. 

Following this, click the "Run App" button above the user.R script or server.R script to run the visualisation in your default web browser. 

The ValuesScript.R file shows the method by which the data was prepared for this visualisation.

All the best, 


Will.
